## Taking care of your eyes

### Some rest
Screens are a big cause of myopia for digital workers. To take care of them, you should apply the 3-20 rule by looking at a point 20 meters away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes to relax your eyes. Hulotte will help you remember this!

> Tips : for those who work in an environment without 20 meters clearance, put a mirror behind your screen to artificially increase the distance!

### Keep your distance
It is strongly advised to keep a distance of at least 50 centimeters between your computer screen and your eyes, as well as on your smartphone and laptop, see the section [A healthy workstation](#a-healthy-workstation) for more information.
